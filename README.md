WIP GameBoy/ GameBoy Color emulator in Javascript

A project to toy with JS a little, focusing on speed and code clarity.
At the moment it can pass all 11 BLARGS Instrs tests, i hope i can get some free time in the next year to implement more things...

# TODO
- Sprites, more mappers, sound, color mode, add debugging, controls, sprite editor in browser, some sort of online play.
